# **Knotes**
Notetaking is very important for learning and retaining knowledge in a course. Many times there are students who were unable to make it to a class, or students with disabilities unable to take the notes themselves. Sharing notes can be a beneficial way to overcome both these problems.

Knotes is a online service that allows users to upload their class notes and convert them into a compilation of texts and images. On the Knotes websites, users can view other notes uploaded by their fellow classmates and show their support with a like, allowing the user who liked the note to save it for later, and the note itself being prioritized for other classmates browsing the course.
