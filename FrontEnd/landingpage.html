      Knotes is an online platform where students can upload and share their class notes. These notes are compiled into easy-to-read formats with both text and images. Users can browse through notes shared by classmates, show their support with a like, and save their favorites for later. Popular notes get prioritized, making it easier for students to find the best study resources for their courses.
